# A florist sells roses and tulips in his florist shop. One day, he prepared 150 roses for 50 cents each, and 100 tulips for 40 cents each. He sold everything but 15 roses and 25 tulips. Calculate the difference between his earnings from roses and his earnings from tulips. Then, express the amount in dollars. Print the result.

dif = ((150 - 15)* 50 - (100 - 25) * 40) / 100
